# Phase 2, Plan 1 Summary: Create SST v4 Infrastructure Package

## Completed Tasks
| # | Task | Status | Commit |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Create infra package skeleton | ✅ Done | 3b21448f |
| 2 | Create sst.config.ts | ✅ Done | 3b21448f |
| 3 | Create Lambda function handlers | ✅ Done | 3b21448f |
| 4 | Update monorepo workspace | ✅ Done | already covered by packages/* glob |

## Notes
- sst.config.ts excluded from tsconfig includes — SST types are generated by `sst dev` and don't exist until first run
- Lambda handlers compile cleanly via tsc --noEmit
- Resource imports commented out until deployment
